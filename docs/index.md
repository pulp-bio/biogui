# BioGUI

BioGUI is designed to be a flexible and extensible platform for real-time monitoring of biomedical signals (e.g., sEMG, ECG, EEG). It provides a high-performance visualization interface and a modular architecture to easily integrate new acquisition boards.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: High-speed plotting of multi-channel signals.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend with new board interfaces.
- **Configurable**: Define sampling rates, gains, and decoding logic.
- **Built-in Utilities**: Tools for signal post-processing and offline analysis.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Python and PySide6, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
